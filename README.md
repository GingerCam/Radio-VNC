# Radio-VNC
This project is for VNC without internet to control an SDR

It uses GQRX to control the SDR and hostapd and dnsmasq for the access point

Easy install on Raspberry Pi

"curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GingerCam/Radio-VNC/main/setup.sh | sudo bash"

This project is being actively worked on by myself (GingerCam) and any feekback is greatly apreciated.

It is recomended to install to a new SD card or USB drive so you don't loose any data. 

To do list

Add an uninstall script 
Maybe make it an application rather than comsuming a whole SD card for this project
