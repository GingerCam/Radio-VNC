# Radio-VNC
This project is for VNC without internet to control an SDR

It uses GQRX to control the SDR and hostapd and dnsmasq for the access point

# Easy install on Raspberry Pi

"curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GingerCam/Radio-VNC/main/setup.sh | sudo bash"

This project is being actively worked on by myself (GingerCam) and any feedback is greatly appreciated.

It is recommended to install to a new SD card or USB drive so you don't loose any data.

#To do list

Add an uninstall script

Maybe make it an application rather than consuming a whole SD card for this project
